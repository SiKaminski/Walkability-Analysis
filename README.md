# Walkability Analysis

## About

The primary objective of this project was to gather both conventional and geospatial data regarding the topic of car dependency indicators, such as cars per household, average commute time to work, location affordability, etc, and determine the level of dependence a certain area has on vehicles. Questions asked through this analysis are focused on answering which neighborhood-level factors, such as job accessibility, walkability, transit availability, and housing affordability, are the strongest predictors of car dependency. Answering these questions will help to understand and predict future car dependency using current measures of transportation infrastructure, public transit access, and quality-of-life indicators. These questions will also help to answer what neighborhoods are projected to experience the greatest increases in car dependency if housing development continues without corresponding investment in transit infrastructure.
