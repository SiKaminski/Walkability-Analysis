## Data

All data is contained in the `datasets` directory. The data is split into groups by state, with subdirectories for each state named by its abriviation (AZ, NY, CA, etc...)

To import the data into the colab session first tar the data to `data.tar.gz` by using the following command in the root directory of the repository

```bash
tar -czvf data.tar.gz datasets/
```

(By default through the .gitignore file it will be ignored so it is not in the repository)
